# Coding Task

# Getting Started

The given TfRecord ```record_test.tfrecord``` is generated by using ```TfRecord_Generator.py```. 
The dataset consist of three images.

# Tasks

Modify and complete the file ```task_run_cnn.py``` to solve the upcomming three tasks:

## Task 1 - Read TfRecord:

Complete the method ```CNN.getInput()``` of the class CNN ```CNN``` to read the individuall images of the dataset ```record_test.tfrecord```.

## Task 2 - Define Gausian-Filter
            
Define a 5x5 [Gausian Filter](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/gsmooth.htm) and apply it in the method ```CNN.inference(img)``` to the input ```img```.
Use a Tensorflow graph for this taks. ```CNN.inference(img)``` should return an Tensor.

## Task 3 - Apply the Gausian-Filter

Finally, apply the Gausian-Filter to the image of Homer Simpson within a Tensorflow session.
Generate a Github branch and provide the final image of Homer and a snapshot of the Gausian-Filter. 
Use a Tensorflow [Saver](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Saver) object for this task.
